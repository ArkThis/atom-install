# atom-install

Scripted install routines for AtoM (Artefactual)


# Tested on ubuntu-server 24.04.3

These scripts are "works-for-me", and on my homework-list to be converted to ansible. And before I do that, I'd rather search the web if anyone has already done and published that, so I don't have to. :wink:


# Usage & Structure

The installation is broken down into those components (=scripts):


## Subfolder `install`

  - `setup-atom.sh`:
    General install script.

  - `setup-atom-db.sh`:
    Instructions for initializing the database.

  - `setup-atom-site.sh`:
    Instructions for setting up the nginx-config for the AtoM website.

  - `setup-atom-ssl.sh`:
    **(optional)** Configures SSL certificates for https access (Let's Encrypt)
    

The first script calls the other scripts automatically when it's their turn.

The installation routines are basically a script-version of 
the [official installation instructions](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/2.9/admin-manual/installation/ubuntu/#installation-ubuntu).
